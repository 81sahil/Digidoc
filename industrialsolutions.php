                            <p class="desc mb-15" >The ease and accessibility of digital documents make converting to a paperless document management system well worth the price of admission.</p>

                            <p class="desc mb-15" > Here are just a few of the benefits that document scanning and document management systems have brought to the education system:</p>
                            <h6>Better Compliance</h6>
                            <p class="desc mb-15" >Digital documents can be encrypted, password-protected, and easily identified to eliminate the risk of a violation. Sending electronic documents by e-mail rather than fax ensures confidential, password-protected delivery to a private inbox rather than a public fax machine. </p> 
                            <p class="desc mb-15" >You can also redact any necessary information for scanned documents prior to scanning, storing, or sending. </p> 
                            <h6>Streamlined Processes and Increased Productivity</h6>
                            <p class="desc mb-15" >Maintaining and regularly accessing hard-copy files for any department can be taxing on resources and office space. </p> 
                            <p class="desc mb-15" > Digital documents eliminate dozens of file cabinets instantly, and you can find the information that used to be stored in filing cabinets in seconds with a quick keyword search.</p> 
                            <p class="desc mb-15" > Electronic documents also eliminate the accidental misplaced or duplicate file which can become a critical mistake when it comes to financial aid and admissions. You can fit a whole room of filing cabinets on a cloud storage system </p> 
                            <h6>Disaster Recovery and Security</h6>
                            <p class="desc mb-15" >Having a backup plan for any document management system is essential to ensure that you don’t lose critical information. Use DigiDocConvergence to find a system that integrates with your existing management systems and computers.</p>
                            <p class="desc mb-15" >Critical documents, records, and other proprietary information are instantly saved and stored offsite on a secure server, allowing you to access it immediately if necessary. Educational firms can increase the security of documents with encryption authentication, redaction, and the ability to track, access and changes to documents.</p>
                            <h6>Increased Visibility and Shareability</h6>
                            <p class="desc mb-15" >Digital documents provide an affordable, easy way to share and access documents remotely. Electronic documents are easy to share with parents, administrators, and students, and If you get requests for paper documents, they can easily be converted to PDF format or an editable text document.</p>
